## 1 Introduction

This project will develop, test, and deploy an Android app to play a simple, one-player, Boggle-style board game.

## 2 Process Description

### D2 - Inception and Elaboration
-   **Complete readme deliverables**
	   - *Description:* The Project Plan, Design Document, Test Plan, and Use Case Model must be completed and submitted before the end-of-the-week deadline
	   - *Entrance:* Defined Program Requirements, UML complete
	   - *Exit:* Completed deliverables, filled out and approved/reviewed by team, submitted through Canvas
	   
-   **Define Team Roles**
	   - *Description:* The 4 different team roles must be defined and assigned according to everyone’s preference/comfort level
	   - *Entrance:* Name/define the 4 roles before assigning
	   - *Exit:* Properly defined and approved team roles
### D3 - Construction
-   **Complete UX/UI**
	- *Description:* The way that the user interacts with the game must be defined and implemented in the Android environment
	- *Entrance:* Mockups defined and approved, development environment set up and code checked out/branched appropriately
	- *Exit:* Completed Main Screen, Settings, Statistics, and Game Play screens

-   **Complete Main Screen Class**
	- *Description:* The ‘home’ page or ‘landing screen’ must be developed and implemented in the Android environment according to project requirements.
	- *Entrance:* Completed and approved class diagram and use case model to base development on. Test cases thoroughly defined.
	- *Exit:* Test cases pass and requirements are met.

-   **Complete Settings Class**
	- *Description:* The Settings screen must be developed and implemented in the Android environment according to project requirements.
	- *Entrance:* Completed and approved class diagram and use case model to base development on. Test cases thoroughly defined.
	- *Exit:* Test cases pass and requirements are met.

-   **Complete Statistics**
	- *Description:* The ‘home’ page or ‘landing screen’ must be developed and implemented in the Android 	environment according to project requirements.
	- *Entrance:* Completed and approved class diagram and use case model to base development on. Test cases thoroughly defined.
	 - *Exit:* Test cases pass and requirements are met.

-   **Complete Game Play Screen**
	- *Description:* The ‘home’ page or ‘landing screen’ must be developed and implemented in the Android environment according to project requirements.
	- *Entrance:* Completed and approved class diagram and use case model to base development on. Test cases thoroughly defined.
	- *Exit:* Test cases pass and requirements are met. All team members sign off on game-play.
 
 -   **Alpha/Beta Release**
	- *Description:* The app must be packaged into a release version in an alpha/beta form.
	- *Entrance:* Team members will agree on an ‘MVP’ which release version must meet.
	- *Exit:* MVP is met, all necessary branches are merged appropriately, all team members agree app is releasable, app is tested in multiple environments and release notes are made.

### D4 - Transistion
-   **Revise Documents**
	-  	*Description:* Previously-submitted documents like the test plan, use case model, class diagram, etc must be revised if necessary to match the ways in which the app has changed from design through development and release.
	- *Entrance:* Previously-submitted documents and a list of ways in which the app now differs from them.
	- *Exit:* Documents comprehensively address the aforementioned list of variations. Team members agree that the app has a 1:1 correspondence to the documents to the best of the group’s ability.
    
-   **Final Testing**
	- *Description:* Final tests must be ran before releasing the app.
	-   *Entrance:* Final version of the test plan, release candidate version of the app must be ready for testing
	-   *Exit:* All tests pass
    
-   **Final Release**
-   Description: The app must be packaged into a release version in its final form.
    -   Entrance: Team members will agree on an ‘MVP’ which release version must meet. App passes final test plan tests.
    -   Exit: MVP is met, all necessary branches are merged appropriately, all team members agree app is releasable, app is tested in multiple environments and release notes are made.
